👨🏻‍💻 I'm a second year PhD student at Virginia Tech co-advised by Dr. Thang Hoang and Dr. Taejoong Chung..

🔬 My research interests are solving real-world network security problems with fancy cryptographic tools

📚 I'm currently working with fancy crypto protocols like - zero-knowledge proof, multiparty computation, cryptographic accumulators, etc to make Web PKI, Email PKI more secured and better.



## 📜 News
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).
